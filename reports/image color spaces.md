#TYPES OF COLOR SPACES
##RGB color space

What RGB model states, that each color image is actually formed of three different images. Red image, Blue image, and green image.
Color image is actually composed of three different matrices:
One color image matrix = red matrix + blue matrix + green matrix

###Applications of RGB
The common applications of RGB model are:
- Cathode ray tube (CRT)
- Liquid crystal display (LCD)
- Plasma Display or LED display such as a television


##Grayscale

A normal grayscale image can be defined by only one matrix.

###Application of Grayscale
-  For many applications of image processing, color information doesn't help us identify important edges or other features so converting the image into grayscale will make the work simpler.
- Complexity of the code is reduced
- higher speed is achieved 

##HSV

The HSV color space (Hue, Saturation, Value) is often used by people who are selecting colors (e.g., of paints or inks) from a color wheel or palette, because it corresponds better to how people experience color than the RGB color space does



##Y'CbCr

Y’CbCr color model contains Y’, the luma component and cb and cr are the blue-difference and red difference chroma components.
Its common applications include JPEG and MPEG compression
