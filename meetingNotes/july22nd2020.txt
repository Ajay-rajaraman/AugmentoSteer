> write a function (computeSobelEdges) to run the sobel edge detection algorithm. This function should accept :
	1. kernel size
	2. horizontal/vertical : string
	3. image
	4. stride length

> go through opencv techniques to resize image (cv2.imresize)

> go through other edge detection algorithms such as Canny and prewitt
	> write a report on this by the end of the day. Include Sobel as well in the report. 
	The report should not contain any plagiarized materials
