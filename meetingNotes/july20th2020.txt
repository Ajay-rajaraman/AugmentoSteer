> write a function thresholdObject that takes in 2 parameters: 
	1. image
	2. threshold list [R,G,B]

> the function has to be implemented in such a way that only value among the threshold values will be non-zero

> return the corresponding layer :R /G /B. After thresholding the values in such a way that pixels with value less than threshold is set to zero.

> use this mask that is returned on the original image to extract information from it. 

> MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT : you are NOT allowed to use OpenCV's threshold function to perform the thresholding. 
> You are also NOT allowed to copy code.
